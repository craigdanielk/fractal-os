# PHASE 04 — ALPHA
# STATUS: GENERATED — PHASE 04 READY
BEGIN: PHASE_04_ALPHA
GOAL: Patch critical cross-module dependencies in cockpit and kernel to ensure stable dev-mode launch.
ACTIONS:
  - VERIFY directory integrity for cockpit/lib, cockpit/services, kernel/utils.
  - SCAN for missing imports using machine-to-machine static analysis.
  - AUTO-GENERATE patches for:
      * missing safe-query references
      * mismatched import paths
      * undefined shared types
      * outdated realtime-manager bindings
  - APPLY patches using PATCH_FILE blocks.
  - RUN static typecheck: `cd cockpit && npm run typecheck`
  - ON SUCCESS: append "PHASE_04_ALPHA_SUCCESS" to /fractal-state/FractalOS_STATE_LOG.md
  - ON FAILURE: append error block and HALT orchestrator.

END: PHASE_04_ALPHA
