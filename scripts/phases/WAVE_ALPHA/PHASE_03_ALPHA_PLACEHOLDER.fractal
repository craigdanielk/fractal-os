# PHASE 03 — ALPHA
# STATUS: ACTIVE
# Purpose: Begin extraction of all unresolved routing, dynamic export, and layout cascade issues.

BEGIN:PHASE_03_ALPHA

GOAL:
- Extract all remaining Next.js routing failures.
- Identify unresolved 404 cascades.
- Detect broken dynamic exports.
- Map missing route groups and wrong segment hierarchies.
- Prepare the actionable repair set for PHASE_04.

TASKS:
1. Scan `/cockpit/app` for:
   - orphaned folders
   - missing `page.tsx`
   - duplicated `layout.tsx`
   - invalid route groups `(routes)`
   - shadowed routes / conflicting dynamic params

2. Validate:
   - `export const dynamic` usage
   - middleware segment matches
   - RSC/Client boundary conflicts

3. Output a structured report into:
   `/scripts/phases/WAVE_ALPHA/PHASE_03_REPORT.json`

4. Append phase completion entry to:
   `/fractal-state/FractalOS_STATE_LOG.md`
